  <p class="p3" id="p3">Gundam is a Japanese media franchise centered around giant robots called "mobile suits." The franchise was created in 1979 and has since become a massive global phenomenon, with numerous spin-off series, films, manga, video games, and other forms of media. The setting of the franchise is a universe where various factions with their own advanced technology engage in warfare. The mobile suits, piloted by characters, serve as the franchise's central focus and are depicted as formidable weapons capable of intense combat and performing various tasks. The original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series popularized the mecha anime genre and remains a classic among fans of the genre. Over the years, the franchise has expanded and evolved, featuring a variety of themes and storylines, but always maintaining the core concept of giant robots in a futuristic setting. The iconic status of Gundam in Japanese pop culture and its lasting popularity are a testament to its impact on the world of anime and science fiction.</p>

  <p class="p5" id="p5">Space calendar 0079. Nearly 10 billion people, half of the Earth's total population, have immigrated to space colonies (space cities) floating around the Earth. The colony farthest from Earth, called Side 3, called itself the Principality of Zeon and launched a war of independence against the Earth Federation government. The dictatorship of Side 3, the Zabi family, is trying to rule over all of humanity. At the beginning of the battle, the Earth Forces, accustomed to a lazy life, are outnumbered. Colonies are dropped one after another, and the Federation forces lose half of their population. The Zeon forces develop a mobile suit "Zaku" that interferes with radar, giving them an advantage in battle. Despite being belated, the Federation Forces also succeeded in developing a mobile suit, and the final test was conducted at Colony Side 7. At Side 7, a ship carrying Major Aznable, the combat commander of the Zeon forces, arrived. Amuro Ray, a computer maniac who lives in Side 7, accidentally obtains a Gundam and its manual and confronts Zeon. Set in the vastness of outer space, Ray and his fellow boys and girls grow up as full-fledged warriors during quagmire battles. Is there a future for humanity in this battle?</p>
